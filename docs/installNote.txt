tailwind: https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

Configure your template paths
Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.

  /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
 export default {
>   content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  }

(I have re-organised my project folderstructure and moved the index.html to the project root for easy deployment on github pages
there for the content searchstring has changed to: "./index.html", "./src/**/*.{html,js}"
tailwind needs to be able to watch all html and js files to adjust it's output.css accordingly)

to see code changes reflected you have to rebuild, this should be running: (in a freshly cloned VSC space first run: "npm install")
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
