tailwind: https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

Configure your template paths
Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.

  /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
 export default {
>   content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  }

(I have re-organised my project folderstructure and moved the index.html to the project root for easy deployment on github pages
there for the content searchstring has changed to: "./index.html", "./src/**/*.{html,js}"
tailwind needs to be able to watch all html and js files to adjust it's output.css accordingly)

(if something goes wrong in the output file it can be deleted? and running the  watch(build) will generate a new one 
-> test in a throwaway project first)

to see code changes reflected you have to rebuild, this should be running: (in a freshly cloned VSC space first run: "npm install")
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
